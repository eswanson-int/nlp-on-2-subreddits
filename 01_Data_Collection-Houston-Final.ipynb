At the moment roughly half of it is covered with cement and there is a permanent basketball goal as well. I know i'll have to get rid of the cement and the basketball goal and probably get some fencing to segment a piece of the back yard.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI really have no clue as to how I go about doing this project. Is the best way to go about this through a site like HomeAdvisor and the like? A slew of homes in our neighborhood have these sort of building/garages but I think most of them have been there for decades.\",\n",

       "Hello Houston. I’m currently in Navasota, visiting from Michigan for a wedding on Saturday. Headed back to airport on Sunday. Anybody have recommendations on how to get back to airport? My rental car was not at airport when I arrived last night and I took an Uber here ($173, yikes). I’d like to try and schedule something ASAP but Uber won’t let me schedule anything (I guess I can try Lyft as well) and not being from around here I thought I would ask here first since local Reddit people are the best to go to first. \\n\\nThanks \\n\\nP.S: we may spend some time in Houston (if we can get there) before our flight on Sunday night, any place my wife and I should eat at ?                                                                                                                                                150\n",

       "Recently moved to Houston (on the cusp of Montrose and Fourth Ward) and have had quite a few packages picked off this past week. I’m eyeing a Nest security camera to go along with my Google Nest Hub, but I’m wondering if the technology can withstand the summer heat. Anyone else have a Google Nest outdoor battery camera and can speak to its performance with the heat, or a suggestion for a camera / options that works with the Google Nest Hub? I didn’t even consider the heat aspect until someone mentioned their battery exploded. 😬 \\n\\nLikewise, open to suggestions for securing packages. My landlord mentioned Amazon Lockers, but I don’t always order from Amazon. Not used to townhouse life without a place to secure packages, so welcoming all suggestions!                                                       150\n",

       "Few questions: My wife and I are firm believers that every kid should have their own pet, so we’re currently looking at getting a dog for our 7 year old daughter. With that said, we like to go, go, go on the weekends. Not every weekend, but at least once a month. \\n\\n1. Traveling dog owners, how have your experiences been taking small dogs on road trips? Can I assume that more and more nicer hotels are allowing pets? \\n\\n2. Also, we live in the middle of Houston with only a back patio. Although there’s a park across the street, we’d like to look into purchasing an outdoor artificial grass area for the dog to use the restroom. Have you used something similar for your dog(s)? Advantages? Disadvantages? Is there one in particular you recommend? \\n\\nThanks in advance and have a great Labor Day weekend!       1\n",
