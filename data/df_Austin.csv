Austin,New Uber user question,"Probs is kinda more Uber-centric but it does involve Austin specifically.

First time I'll be using Uber, and also new to the city (hi). I'm going to need to go from around the Zilker area to the airport in a couple weeks, arriving there around 5am.

So for the past couple mornings, I would fire up the Uber app at 4:15am and go through the process of ordering a ride without actually ordering. While there's always availability, the prices range wildly from $25 to $80 as I continually check it for a 30 minute period.

Is this just how it is? Am I going to have to be ready to leave upwards of 30 minutes early on the airport day and just keep refreshing the app hoping to get a good price in that 30-minute period? Or is there a better way? I know I can schedule one but upon seeing what others say, it seems its really no different than just ordering a ride manually 15 minutes before you need it.

What is common to do in this circumstance? Thanks!",1630951790

Austin,Boomer businesses: can we stop giving them business?,"Hear me out. For my entire adult life I have had strictly boomers for bosses. I have worked in restaurants, schools as a teacher, labor like plumbing and construction and at all of these jobs I have been completely and utterly abused and disrespected. 
The latest example I’ll give is when I was a plumber. The work was hard but I was willing and able to do it because I was promised large amounts of money as well as a job for life. I am a large guy use to lift weights almost everyday (I plan on going back in a month or so) so I was able to lift heavy equipment and dig hard and fast in the Texas heat. The problems with my boss started coming when he would visit job sites when it was 105 degrees plus outside and I had stopped work for water and shade breaks. I won’t get into much detail but he wasn’t happy with the breaks. The final straw came when I lost consciousness under a house and was woken by a coworker of mine. Come to find out there are safety preparations that have to happen before plumbing under a house can occurs and my boss man thought it was unnecessary to have enough oxygen in narrow pits underneath homes. Long story short: I almost died and I quit. And I never got the money I was promised 

That was probably the worst job I’ve had. 
Before I took that job I actually had my own repair company and was doing well on my own which I’m starting up again.

It just seems like every boomer boss I’ve had is liked this. Ill equipped, angry, and just kinda fraudulent. 

I understand that this is an unpopular drastic thing but I think a general boycott of all boomer businesses would open up the market to younger business people since the boomies just won’t relent in any of aspect of society.",1630948976
Austin,You! You’re cordially invited to play Dungeons and Dragons this Tuesday,"
Good morning! ☀️ 

I’m looking to run a one-shot(one time game) this Tuesday at 7pm at the local game friendly venue.  This session will cater largely to new players, and gentle, inclusive non munchie crunchy veteran players. 

The setting is standard swords and sorcery style medieval times, magic is fairly common.

There is a chance that this may develop into a weekly or biweekly 5e campaign with the right people and schedule. Feel free to chat with any questions.


Campaign pitch:

Mother’s Holy Avenger

True evil is forever vanquished!
This medieval world is finally at peace, but peace is…boring.

In this vacuum a new widespread phenomenon has burgeoned; branded adventuring party entertainment. 

One such epic recorded battle between famed adventurers and villains goes south as the villains break the biggest rule of their contract; open murder. 
In the fray the cameras are damaged, and the villains, now wanted fugitives, escape.  

Several years later…you (and those inspired by their actions) aim to find closure by attending The Heroic Entertainment Network’s “Adventurer Tryouts.” 

On this bright Moonsday morning you set out for acclaim, answers,and in more cases than not…(a)vengeance.


Cheers!",1630945421
Austin,Mental Health Services for low income,"Who in Austin has suggestions for me for mental health counseling services on a $16/hr wage? I just moved to Austin from Utah and am still on my Utah health insurance because it’s waaaaaaaaaaay cheaper than any of the “Affordable Care Act” plans offered in Texas, but I guarantee every single mental health place in Austin is going to be out of network, therefore forcing me to pay like $85-$100 per counseling session even though I have health insurance.

Austin,Booster shots @ ARC?,"I got an email about a week and a half ago from ARC saying they have booster vaccines available for 18+. I was under the impression boosters are only for immunocompromised who are 6 months out or if you’re 8 months out from the 2nd shot. I’m exactly 6 months past my 2nd, so I logged on the MyChart app and signed up for an appointment. They asked if I was immunocompromised (no) and if it was at least 6 months past my last vaccine (yes) and they gave me an appointment for this week. Then an article popped up on my phone saying [Pfizer Covid booster shots will likely be ready Sept. 20, but Moderna may be delayed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/05/pfizer-covid-booster-shots-likely-ready-sept-20-anthony-fauci-says.html) So I guess I’m just confused what ARC is giving me if the boosters are even ready. Should I cancel and wait until after Sept 20? Why is ARC offering boosters so early if they’re not even ready? Is a booster just exactly the same as the normal shot or is it something different that’s supposed to be better against the variants.",1630943176

Then hours later, here you are trying to fix it.

Austin,College advice; getting into UT?,"Any tips/advice for college admissions and getting into UT? A little context, my little brother is 17 and going into his senior year of high school outside of Seattle, WA. I’m 10 years older than him and have always felt like more of a mother figure than an older sister. Our home life growing up was rough, even more so for him. 

Our mom has severe Parkinson’s disease and would abuse her medication which would but her into a psychosis state. She would have maniac episodes (really ever since my little brother was super young) and I feel he has been impacted by not having a mother figure/example. Our dad is very ill a lot of the time, as he contracted hepatitis C when he was 4 years old from a bad blood transfusion (before they tested blood). My parents HATE each other and fight constantly. Our grandma lives there as well, as she has health issues and needs to be taken care of. Because of the age gap between my little brother and I, he was at home by himself with this home life throughout elementary, middle and high school. I moved out of state when I was 17 to go to college. At the time, I felt like I was trapped and needed to escape the environment and as a dumb 17 year old, I left him in this unhealthy environment.

My partner and I live in Austin and he came to visit us and completely fell in love with Austin and UT (who wouldn’t, right?). With our home life, he has struggled to know what options he has or even what he should do after high school, but I also think he feels stuck and that he doesn’t have a whole lot of support. I’ve been encouraging him to look into colleges and want to help him as much as I can. He has struggled with his grades the last year and a half since having to do online school due to COVID and he currently has a 3.2 GPA. He hasn’t taken the SAT/ACT yet, and I am trying to help him take a prep course before he does. 

He really is such a bright kid, he just hasn’t been dealt the best cards. I know that UT is a hard school to get into. I told him we should sit down and map out next steps. I want him to feel motivated, but also want to be realistic with him. Does anyone have any advice? Or what some great options may be?

Austin,Scam alert : using debit/credit card to purchase will call at Home Depot,"My friend who used to live here, but moved out of state over a year ago, got hit with a fraudulent charge of over $7000 with a card they opened in their new state, with a new bank. They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?

Austin,Scam alert : using debit/credit card to purchase will call at Home Depot,"My friend who used to live here, but moved out of state over a year ago, got hit with a fraudulent charge of over $7000 with a card they opened in their new state, with a new bank. They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?  


They are on line with Home Depot to try to resolve the issue, but how f'ed is that.

They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?

I'm used to moving way up into the intersection while I wait for an opening in opposing traffic, and usually the car or two behind can also get into the intersection.

It's been many times that I've been in a long line of cars waiting to go left, and every light rotation only one car makes it through.

Austin,Scam alert : using debit/credit card to purchase will call at Home Depot,"My friend who used to live here, but moved out of state over a year ago, got hit with a fraudulent charge of over $7000 with a card they opened in their new state, with a new bank. They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?

I'm used to moving way up into the intersection while I wait for an opening in opposing traffic, and usually the car or two behind can also get into the intersection. That way when the light turns red, a few cars can make their left and be on their way. It's been many times that I've been in a long line of cars waiting to go left, and every light rotation only one car makes it through.

They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?

They're raising funds via Venmo (Ani’s owner Rachael Garbowski (@ Rachael-Garbowski)) to cover the food truck losses and add more security to prevent it from occurring again. If you're around the trucks are open and super delicious. The Nyam Sunshine Cuisine Yawdy and Floridian are my favorites.

I'm used to moving way up into the intersection while I wait for an opening in opposing traffic, and usually the car or two behind can also get into the intersection. That way when the light turns red, a few cars can make their left and be on their way. It's been many times that I've been in a long line of cars waiting to go left, and every light rotation only one car makes it through. I'm not saying anyone has to do anything dangerous or adversely effect any other normal traffic movements, it just seems to be a matter of efficiency.

Austin,Scam alert : using debit/credit card to purchase will call at Home Depot,"My friend who used to live here, but moved out of state over a year ago, got hit with a fraudulent charge of over $7000 with a card they opened in their new state, with a new bank. They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?  


They are on line with Home Depot to try to resolve the issue, but how f'ed is that.

Austin,Scam alert : using debit/credit card to purchase will call at Home Depot,"My friend who used to live here, but moved out of state over a year ago, got hit with a fraudulent charge of over $7000 with a card they opened in their new state, with a new bank. They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?

Austin,Scam alert : using debit/credit card to purchase will call at Home Depot,"My friend who used to live here, but moved out of state over a year ago, got hit with a fraudulent charge of over $7000 with a card they opened in their new state, with a new bank. They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?

I'm used to moving way up into the intersection while I wait for an opening in opposing traffic, and usually the car or two behind can also get into the intersection.

It's been many times that I've been in a long line of cars waiting to go left, and every light rotation only one car makes it through.

Austin,Scam alert : using debit/credit card to purchase will call at Home Depot,"My friend who used to live here, but moved out of state over a year ago, got hit with a fraudulent charge of over $7000 with a card they opened in their new state, with a new bank. They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?

I'm used to moving way up into the intersection while I wait for an opening in opposing traffic, and usually the car or two behind can also get into the intersection. That way when the light turns red, a few cars can make their left and be on their way. It's been many times that I've been in a long line of cars waiting to go left, and every light rotation only one car makes it through.

They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?

They're raising funds via Venmo (Ani’s owner Rachael Garbowski (@ Rachael-Garbowski)) to cover the food truck losses and add more security to prevent it from occurring again. If you're around the trucks are open and super delicious. The Nyam Sunshine Cuisine Yawdy and Floridian are my favorites.

I'm used to moving way up into the intersection while I wait for an opening in opposing traffic, and usually the car or two behind can also get into the intersection. That way when the light turns red, a few cars can make their left and be on their way. It's been many times that I've been in a long line of cars waiting to go left, and every light rotation only one car makes it through. I'm not saying anyone has to do anything dangerous or adversely effect any other normal traffic movements, it just seems to be a matter of efficiency.

Austin,Scam alert : using debit/credit card to purchase will call at Home Depot,"My friend who used to live here, but moved out of state over a year ago, got hit with a fraudulent charge of over $7000 with a card they opened in their new state, with a new bank. They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?  


They are on line with Home Depot to try to resolve the issue, but how f'ed is that.

Austin,Scam alert : using debit/credit card to purchase will call at Home Depot,"My friend who used to live here, but moved out of state over a year ago, got hit with a fraudulent charge of over $7000 with a card they opened in their new state, with a new bank. They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?

Austin,Scam alert : using debit/credit card to purchase will call at Home Depot,"My friend who used to live here, but moved out of state over a year ago, got hit with a fraudulent charge of over $7000 with a card they opened in their new state, with a new bank. They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?

I'm used to moving way up into the intersection while I wait for an opening in opposing traffic, and usually the car or two behind can also get into the intersection.

It's been many times that I've been in a long line of cars waiting to go left, and every light rotation only one car makes it through.

Austin,Scam alert : using debit/credit card to purchase will call at Home Depot,"My friend who used to live here, but moved out of state over a year ago, got hit with a fraudulent charge of over $7000 with a card they opened in their new state, with a new bank. They have never used that card in Austin.

Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  
Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?

Seriously, i grew up in Hyde Park, lived near the Intramural Fields where those monk parakeet lived all up in the lights and had spread to the surrounding neighborhoods back in the 90s.  Theyre not really annoying, theyre just loud AF.",1630799160
Austin,Austin City Limits Has No Parking?,"Hey everybody, first time ACL attendant (hopeful) here, and I heard that acl has no designated parking? I looked into this and it looks like there’s no parking whatsoever, not even paid parking in Zilker? How do you veterans park when attending the festival? I’d imagine there has to be a lot of parking given how many people attend the festivities, so what would be the best and cheapest way to go about things? I, btw, am not familiar with Austin and it’s layout as a city.",1630797694

Austin,Food truck break ins @ Ani's Day &amp; Night.,"[https://www.instagram.com/p/CTXcGXsFXPK/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTXcGXsFXPK/)

Some losers broke into the amazing food trucks at Ani's Day &amp; Night and stole money, equipment, and product :( Breaks my heart as they work so damn hard. Apparently it's been happening to lots of food trucks lately.

They're raising funds via Venmo (Ani’s owner Rachael Garbowski (@ Rachael-Garbowski)) to cover the food truck losses and add more security to prevent it from occurring again. If you're around the trucks are open and super delicious. The Nyam Sunshine Cuisine Yawdy and Floridian are my favorites.

Ani's is a gem of a place on Riverside run by quality people so I wanted to boost the signal to raise more support.",1630778734
