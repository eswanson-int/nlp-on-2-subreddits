houston,Want to build a stand alone apartment in backyard,"Hello everyone. I want to build a stand alone apartment in the backyard of the house. The backyard is pretty spacious. At the moment roughly half of it is covered with cement and there is a permanent basketball goal as well. I know i'll have to get rid of the cement and the basketball goal and probably get some fencing to segment a piece of the back yard.

&amp;#x200B;

I really have no clue as to how I go about doing this project. Is the best way to go about this through a site like HomeAdvisor and the like? A slew of homes in our neighborhood have these sort of building/garages but I think most of them have been there for decades.",1630951521

houston,Drug dealer neighbor pointed gun at me when I went outside to investigate a loud noise. Advice?,"We live in a little townhome neighborhood where the townhomes face each other. Early this morning, I put a brisket on my pellet smoker and about an hour later, heard this loud popping noise. I‚Äôm thinking my grill exploded or something so I went outside to investigate. I peaked around the corner and my neighbor is outside his house with like 3 other guys pointing a handgun at me asking ‚Äúwtf the fuck was that noise?‚Äù All while continuing to point the gun at me. I backed away and said I don‚Äôt fucking know, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm out here. He said someone threw shit at his window. I said I didn‚Äôt know anything about it and that it could have been my grill making that noise. He then went ‚Äúoh sorry bro‚Äù and went inside. 

Now this isn‚Äôt the first time he heard a loud noise and came outside with a gun. My gf said a few days before 4th of July, he came out with a ‚Äúgolden ak47‚Äù after hearing a loud noise. Which was probably someone just popping fireworks. 
I am pretty sure they are dealing drugs out of that house. They always have people coming and going and all drive very nice cars for the neighborhood. Talking about BMWs, Mercedes, Maseratis, seen some lambos around too.  I‚Äôve seen someone bring in giant duffel bags into the house before. 

Now what should I do? Should I call and report it to the cops? That he was waiving a gun around? I get someone protecting their house, but if your protecting your house from people wanting to rob you for your drugs/money, that‚Äôs a different story. I feel like that will only cause problems for me if I do. what do y‚Äôall think?",1630931740

houston,Trying to find help for a disabled man getting screwed by his landlord,"Hi everyone,

One of my neighbors is in his 60's and disabled (missing an arm).  He is renting a property that is basically a slum.  It's a 500 sq ft shotgun house from the 40s that is in an advanced state of rot and decay.  

The house has a water leak, rotted side boards, crumbling foundation, and I can occasionally smell urine and sewage coming out of the house from the street when walking by.  I can't believe the house hasn't been condemned.  

I found the landlord, but he's totally contempt to rent out this god awful house.  

I contacted the city through 311, but they just fine him for grass being too long.

I'm no expert, but it seems like there should be some minimum standard of what the landlord is allowed to rent, or some form of ""tenant's rights"" that force the landlord to fix up the property.  At least make it safe to live in.

The tenant is very poor, and refuses to get help himself.  I'm trying to find groups or legal entities that will advocate for him, or at least put some pressure on the landlord to do something other than mow the grass and watch this dude live in a slum.

Does anyone know other groups I can reach out to that will advocate for the tenant?",1630808813

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Houston buyers need to stop buying stucco houses,"I was doing some house hunting lately. Every single stucco house has issues, some costs $100s to fix, some less. But they ALL have problems. This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

If we stop buying stucco, they will have to stop building stucco.",1630766425

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

We have been binging 'MasterChef' for the last month and a half, and we know that Season 3 winner Christine's restaurant The Blind Goat is in Houston and will most likely enjoy a meal there, but we have no figured out what else we would like to do, other than having the desire to check out at least one store each that fits into our interests/hobbies.

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Houston buyers need to stop buying stucco houses,"I was doing some house hunting lately. Every single stucco house has issues, some costs $100s to fix, some less. But they ALL have problems. This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

If we stop buying stucco, they will have to stop building stucco.",1630766425

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

We have been binging 'MasterChef' for the last month and a half, and we know that Season 3 winner Christine's restaurant The Blind Goat is in Houston and will most likely enjoy a meal there, but we have no figured out what else we would like to do, other than having the desire to check out at least one store each that fits into our interests/hobbies.

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Houston buyers need to stop buying stucco houses,"I was doing some house hunting lately. Every single stucco house has issues, some costs $100s to fix, some less. But they ALL have problems. This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

If we stop buying stucco, they will have to stop building stucco.",1630766425

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

We have been binging 'MasterChef' for the last month and a half, and we know that Season 3 winner Christine's restaurant The Blind Goat is in Houston and will most likely enjoy a meal there, but we have no figured out what else we would like to do, other than having the desire to check out at least one store each that fits into our interests/hobbies.

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Houston buyers need to stop buying stucco houses,"I was doing some house hunting lately. Every single stucco house has issues, some costs $100s to fix, some less. But they ALL have problems. This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

If we stop buying stucco, they will have to stop building stucco.",1630766425

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

We have been binging 'MasterChef' for the last month and a half, and we know that Season 3 winner Christine's restaurant The Blind Goat is in Houston and will most likely enjoy a meal there, but we have no figured out what else we would like to do, other than having the desire to check out at least one store each that fits into our interests/hobbies.

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Houston buyers need to stop buying stucco houses,"I was doing some house hunting lately. Every single stucco house has issues, some costs $100s to fix, some less. But they ALL have problems. This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

If we stop buying stucco, they will have to stop building stucco.",1630766425

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

We have been binging 'MasterChef' for the last month and a half, and we know that Season 3 winner Christine's restaurant The Blind Goat is in Houston and will most likely enjoy a meal there, but we have no figured out what else we would like to do, other than having the desire to check out at least one store each that fits into our interests/hobbies.

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Houston buyers need to stop buying stucco houses,"I was doing some house hunting lately. Every single stucco house has issues, some costs $100s to fix, some less. But they ALL have problems. This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

If we stop buying stucco, they will have to stop building stucco.",1630766425

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

We have been binging 'MasterChef' for the last month and a half, and we know that Season 3 winner Christine's restaurant The Blind Goat is in Houston and will most likely enjoy a meal there, but we have no figured out what else we would like to do, other than having the desire to check out at least one store each that fits into our interests/hobbies.

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Houston buyers need to stop buying stucco houses,"I was doing some house hunting lately. Every single stucco house has issues, some costs $100s to fix, some less. But they ALL have problems. This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

If we stop buying stucco, they will have to stop building stucco.",1630766425

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

We have been binging 'MasterChef' for the last month and a half, and we know that Season 3 winner Christine's restaurant The Blind Goat is in Houston and will most likely enjoy a meal there, but we have no figured out what else we would like to do, other than having the desire to check out at least one store each that fits into our interests/hobbies.

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Houston buyers need to stop buying stucco houses,"I was doing some house hunting lately. Every single stucco house has issues, some costs $100s to fix, some less. But they ALL have problems. This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

If we stop buying stucco, they will have to stop building stucco.",1630766425

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

We have been binging 'MasterChef' for the last month and a half, and we know that Season 3 winner Christine's restaurant The Blind Goat is in Houston and will most likely enjoy a meal there, but we have no figured out what else we would like to do, other than having the desire to check out at least one store each that fits into our interests/hobbies.

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:

This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

houston,Houston buyers need to stop buying stucco houses,"I was doing some house hunting lately. Every single stucco house has issues, some costs $100s to fix, some less. But they ALL have problems. This material is simply not suited for Houston's wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.

From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot. It is endless.

If we stop buying stucco, they will have to stop building stucco.",1630766425

houston,Living with Roommates vs Living Alone (Advice),"Hi all!

I am debating living alone in a studio/1bedroom versus finding roommates online.

I've had roommates for the past 7 years and am comfortable sharing a space with people; however, since Houston will be a new city for me and I don't know anyone, I'm a bit nervous about living with complete strangers as well. My main reason for considering roommates is because I won't be lonely and I'd feel safer coming home to other people. What is your personal advice? Do you think it's better to live with roommates or is it safe to live alone in Houston?

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros of Living Alone|Pros of Living with Roommates|
|:-|:-|
|\-personal space/independence|\- company and possibility of new friends|
|\- less risk of COVID|\- won't be lonely in new city|
|\- easier to find an apartment close to work|\- safety in numbers|
|\- don't have to worry about stranger danger in my home lol|\- lower cost since rent will be split|",1630738318

houston,"Visiting Houston, TX for the first time; any suggested sites?","My lady love and I are going to use this holiday weekend to visit Houston for the first time. We are fully vaccinated and will of course be following the safety protocols to ensure the safety of others.

We have been binging 'MasterChef' for the last month and a half, and we know that Season 3 winner Christine's restaurant The Blind Goat is in Houston and will most likely enjoy a meal there, but we have no figured out what else we would like to do, other than having the desire to check out at least one store each that fits into our interests/hobbies.

I am a geek and am big into collecting comic books. Are there any great comic stores that would be recommended in Houston, specifically any that have a good balance between current issues, collectibles, back issues, and collected editions such as hard to find Omnibus, hardcovers, or trade paperbacks?

My lady is on a roll with checking out and purchasing perfumes, and we visit Ulta and Sephora often for her to see if there are any scents worthwhile to add to her collection. She would like to find out if there are any worthwhile stores that could be wholesalers or sell perfumes at discounted prices, as she does buy perfume off websites such as Mercari.

houston,White Van Scammers getting away with Fraud for Decades in the Houston Area,"I'm writing this post compile some information.   
This week I ran into 2 guys in a white SUV that were peddling shoddy Chinese 4k Projectors.  
This was off of 290 and Fry Rd.  
They claim to be owners of a company called ""Sound &amp; Vision"".  
This is apparently a ""White Van Speaker Scam"". I've never heard of it, just researched it after my interaction.

We pulled over in a Buffalo Wild Wing parking lot to discuss. I held them up in the parking lot for quite a while just asking questions and trying to understand what was happening.   
The scheme goes something like this:  


""Hey would you like a crazy deal on a 4K projector?""  
You pull over to talk with them, and the gist is this:  
""We install projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings, there was a mistake in our inventory system and we have 4 projectors instead of 2. If we don't offload these now, the contractors take them for free.""  
""You seem like a cool guy, I'd rather let you have them then the contractors. We're not trying to get rich, we just want positive reviews for our company""  


The projectors are cheap Chinese products intended to be used for fraud. They proudly display the insanely inflated MSRP on the box $7,999.99. In reality they are worth less than $100. There is a product webpage for their crap products which also displays a hyper inflated MSRP. Evidently they have also created sales pages for these things on Ebay and Facebook Market. They are very effective at spewing their scheme, after looking it up they have been doing this for probably over 10 years. There are multiple threads on Reddit alone referencing them:
