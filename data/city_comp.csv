houston,Want to build a stand alone apartment in backyard,Hello everyone. I want to build a stand alone apartment in the backyard of the house. The backyard is pretty spacious. At the moment roughly half of it is covered with cement and there is a permanent basketball goal as well. I know ill have to get rid of the cement and the basketball goal and probably get some fencing to segment a piece of the back yard.I really have no clue as to how I go about doing this project. Is the best way to go about this through a site like HomeAdvisor and the like? A slew of homes in our neighborhood have these sort of building/garages but I think most of them have been there for decades.,1630951521,640,122,0

houston,Drug dealer neighbor pointed gun at me when I went outside to investigate a loud noise. Advice?,"We live in a little townhome neighborhood where the townhomes face each other. Early this morning, I put a brisket on my pellet smoker and about an hour later, heard this loud popping noise. I‚Äôm thinking my grill exploded or something so I went outside to investigate. I peaked around the corner and my neighbor is outside his house with like 3 other guys pointing a handgun at me asking ‚Äúwtf the fuck was that noise?‚Äù All while continuing to point the gun at me. I backed away and said I don‚Äôt fucking know, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm out here. He said someone threw shit at his window. I said I didn‚Äôt know anything about it and that it could have been my grill making that noise. He then went ‚Äúoh sorry bro‚Äù and went inside. Now this isn‚Äôt the first time he heard a loud noise and came outside with a gun. My gf said a few days before 4th of July, he came out with a ‚Äúgolden ak47‚Äù after hearing a loud noise. Which was probably someone just popping fireworks. I am pretty sure they are dealing drugs out of that house. They always have people coming and going and all drive very nice cars for the neighborhood. Talking about BMWs, Mercedes, Maseratis, seen some lambos around too.  I‚Äôve seen someone bring in giant duffel bags into the house before. Now what should I do? Should I call and report it to the cops? That he was waiving a gun around? I get someone protecting their house, but if your protecting your house from people wanting to rob you for your drugs/money, that‚Äôs a different story.

This material is simply not suited for Houstons wet and humid environment. This terrible trend in the 2000s really gotta stop.From my research, stucco is cheaper than brick or even hardie board. They are thinner, therefore allowing houses to be slightly bigger on the same slab. They are lighter than brick, so foundations can be built cheaper or not as strong as brick houses. Everything here benefits the builders. But 10 year down the road, home owners are left holding the bag with a house full of problems, cracking, leaking, wood rot.

Austin,Boomer businesses: can we stop giving them business?,"Hear me out. For my entire adult life I have had strictly boomers for bosses. I have worked in restaurants, schools as a teacher, labor like plumbing and construction and at all of these jobs I have been completely and utterly abused and disrespected. The latest example I‚Äôll give is when I was a plumber. The work was hard but I was willing and able to do it because I was promised large amounts of money as well as a job for life. I am a large guy use to lift weights almost everyday (I plan on going back in a month or so) so I was able to lift heavy equipment and dig hard and fast in the Texas heat. The problems with my boss started coming when he would visit job sites when it was 105 degrees plus outside and I had stopped work for water and shade breaks. I won‚Äôt get into much detail but he wasn‚Äôt happy with the breaks. The final straw came when I lost consciousness under a house and was woken by a coworker of mine. Come to find out there are safety preparations that have to happen before plumbing under a house can occurs and my boss man thought it was unnecessary to have enough oxygen in narrow pits underneath homes. Long story short: I almost died and I quit. And I never got the money I was promised That was probably the worst job I‚Äôve had. Before I took that job I actually had my own repair company and was doing well on my own which I‚Äôm starting up again.It just seems like every boomer boss I‚Äôve had is liked this. Ill equipped, angry, and just kinda fraudulent. I understand that this is an unpopular drastic thing but I think a general boycott of all boomer businesses would open up the market to younger business people since the boomies just won‚Äôt relent in any of aspect of society.",1630948976,1719,328,1

Austin,College advice; getting into UT?,"Any tips/advice for college admissions and getting into UT? A little context, my little brother is 17 and going into his senior year of high school outside of Seattle, WA. I‚Äôm 10 years older than him and have always felt like more of a mother figure than an older sister. Our home life growing up was rough, even more so for him. Our mom has severe Parkinson‚Äôs disease and would abuse her medication which would but her into a psychosis state. She would have maniac episodes (really ever since my little brother was super young) and I feel he has been impacted by not having a mother figure/example. Our dad is very ill a lot of the time, as he contracted hepatitis C when he was 4 years old from a bad blood transfusion (before they tested blood). My parents HATE each other and fight constantly. Our grandma lives there as well, as she has health issues and needs to be taken care of. Because of the age gap between my little brother and I, he was at home by himself with this home life throughout elementary, middle and high school. I moved out of state when I was 17 to go to college. At the time, I felt like I was trapped and needed to escape the environment and as a dumb 17 year old, I left him in this unhealthy environment.My partner and I live in Austin and he came to visit us and completely fell in love with Austin and UT (who wouldn‚Äôt, right?). With our home life, he has struggled to know what options he has or even what he should do after high school, but I also think he feels stuck and that he doesn‚Äôt have a whole lot of support. I‚Äôve been encouraging him to look into colleges and want to help him as much as I can. He has struggled with his grades the last year and a half since having to do online school due to COVID and he currently has a 3.2 GPA. He hasn‚Äôt taken the SAT/ACT yet, and I am trying to help him take a prep course before he does. He really is such a bright kid, he just hasn‚Äôt been dealt the best cards. I know that UT is a hard school to get into. I told him we should sit down and map out next steps. I want him to feel motivated, but also want to be realistic with him. Does anyone have any advice? Or what some great options may be? Really appreciate anyone who took the time to read this post.",1630858905,2244,438,1

Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it.

They have never used that card in Austin.Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?  They are on line with Home Depot to try to resolve the issue, but how fed is that.

Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?  They are on line with Home Depot to try to resolve the issue, but how fed is that.

They have never used that card in Austin.Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?  They are on line with Home Depot to try to resolve the issue, but how fed is that.

Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?  They are on line with Home Depot to try to resolve the issue, but how fed is that.

They have never used that card in Austin.Their card was used to purchase materials at Home Depot. Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?  They are on line with Home Depot to try to resolve the issue, but how fed is that.

Their name, email, current out of state address and payment info was used to purchase materials that were set to be picked up in a north Austin Home Depot location. The items were purchased this evening, with pick up time an hour later, with an alternate pick up name. They know the details because a copy of the receipt/will call order was emailed to them.  Besides being an absurd scam, my friend did not have the $7000 in her account, but instead of Home Depot declining the payment and stopping the order, it went ahead with it. The folks supposedly picked up the order ?!  Maybe because it was after bank hours and Saturday?  They are on line with Home Depot to try to resolve the issue, but how fed is that.
